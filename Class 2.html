    Forms:- behaviours

    Algorithm is a series of steps that does something to remind you, notify you.
    Algorithm is thinking of what you have done to you, Programming is doing what you are doing.
    Your preferences are stored, All you input on internet are actually saved somewhere even if you delet it, it is still stored somewhere.

    Forms are one of the most impontant concept in web development, because you will always collect data.
    forms automatically remember what you have done before, what text you have inputer before to remind you.

    CSS is very interesting and a lot of experimentation, you have to worry more about values here, HTML is worrying about syntax.

    Putting things in container e.g DIV, makes the easier to style.
    Understand how tags works very very well.

    It is how you know something works, that you will make it works the way you want.

    ASSIGNMENT
    1. Explore how other forms attributes works.
    2. Design a form with all input types.
