<!--
    Selcetors are called Attributes in HTML
    .nav
    is a selector

    e.g
    <a class ="nav"
    <a is a tag selector
    class ="nav" is a class selector

    Recarp: Margin and Padding

    Margin and Padding has 4 sides
    Setting to row is in 2 ways,
 
    Margin can be set as
    margin: 10px(for up), 5px(left), 10px (for buttom), 5px(for right).
    margin: 10xp(for top and bottom), 5px(left and right)
    margin: 10px(top), 5px(left and right), 30xp(bottom)
    margin: 10px(for all 4 sides)

    Note that you dont dictate how it works, but you dictate how it gets manipulated.
    margin-top: 10px(for only top)
    margin-left: 10px(for only left) e.t.c

    Border: 1px solid
    can be rewritten as 
    border-width: 1px
    border-outline: solid/dotted/thin

    Other ex:

    border-colour: blue
    border-radius: (to curve the edges) //You can experiment more with other features of border//

    CSS Background.
    background: transparent
    background-image: url(the link for the image) : but you have to deal with size, position and repeat, attachment.
    But, Background-colour: linear-gradient (deals with only mixing colours and one line only)
    e.g in the first code below
